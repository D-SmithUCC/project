        <h1>The Reason</h1>
        In today's world, many people live underprivleged and difficult lives, often because they are unable to find work that pays well, and therefore struggle to attain things that others take for granted, like clean water, electricity, healthcare, tranportation, internet etc. All too often, one generation will pass on these issues to the next; with no apparant way to break the cycle of poverty. That is why affording people around the globe with strong education is so important. Without education, it would be impossible to achieve a high level job, and so the cycle would continue. And that is why supporting initiatives like the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals is so important to building a better world for everyone.
